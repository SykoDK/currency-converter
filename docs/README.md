This website was designed to track changes in currency for up to a year, as well as provide users with the ability to convert from one currency to another using real-time conversion rates. The website features live currency rates, allowing conversion to and from their local currency automatically based on their location. It also features interactive charts that have multiple different ranges, and a converter with a popular conversion leaderboard that is powered by Supabase.

## Target browsers & platforms
Our target platforms are iOS, Android, and Desktop. The user interface is fully responsive on all platforms. On the desktop screen and tablets, it shows a two-column layout, while on a small phone screen, it collapses down into a single column.
